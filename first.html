<h4>Do you think there are other living beings out in the universe? Right now I'm not sure. </br>
I have seen the photos and videos of people, where there are UFOs or even aliens.</br>
But these don't have the best quality and mostly blurry. Maybe in the future we will see if we are alone in the universe or not.</br>
The picture "A city in space" was made by an AI generator. Looks pretty, doesn't it?</br>
I think that many people already know, we can't stay on planet earth forever. The sun is going to become a red giant, which will make the earth</br>
uninhabitable. And before you get an excistencial crisis we can say that this will happen in five billion years. </br>
So you will be surely dead before that happens. But let's get back to aliens.</br>
There is also the Fermi Paradox, but I'm not an expert. What do you think a√∂ien cities would look like?</br>
Just like ours? Or maybe underground? We should hope that whoever is out there, is smart enough to comunicate in some way with us</br>
and not trying to kill us right away.</h4>
